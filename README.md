Blind75: The 75 top LeetCode problems and solutions, by iainjp. Mostly for my own entertainment and learning.


### How to use this repository

I wanted to experiment with the repo reporting it's own successes and stats in the README.md. I'll likely extract some of this out
into a more reusable tool for other scenarios (like Advent Of Code). 

To write the report to README:
> `make report`


To run just the tests:
> `make test`
